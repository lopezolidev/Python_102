Study of python concepts such as Functions, Comprehensions, Errors and more


### Sets
- ##### [What are sets?](sets/01_sets.py)
	- Data structure where:
		- Values are modifiable 
		- Have no specific order
		- There're not repeated elements in the set (very much like the '[sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics))' from discreet math)
	- Are declared with '{}' and inside you type values separated with commas
- ##### [Modifying sets](sets/02_crud_sets.py)
	- **CRUD** process can be done in sets
		- Caveat with *'.remove'* and *'.discard'*, the former requires correct typing for not throwing an error, the latter handles such exception silently
- ##### [Operating sets](sets/03_ops_sets.py)
	- Basic operations of sets theory:
		- **Union**: set A  *OR*  set B → set C
		- **Intersection**: set A  *AND*  set B → set C
		- **Subtraction**: set A  *-*  set B (only elements shared by B) → set C
		- **Symmetric difference**: (set A  *OR*  set B)  *-* (set A  *AND*  set B) → set C
